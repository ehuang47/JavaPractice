| [Java Basics](./week1/d2-java/) | Practice basics of the Java language: variables, data types, wrapper classes, immutability, String pools, control flow, access modifiers, static fields and methods. |
| [Java OOP](./week1/d3-oop/) | Practice OOP with Java: inheritance/polymorphism/abstraction/encapsulation, diamond problem, abstract classes, interfaces, overriding/overloading, toString(), this keyword. |
| [Java Collections](./week1/d4-collections/) | Practice using Java8 collections: List/Queue/Set/Collection interfaces, ArrayList vs LinkedList, Priority Queues, HashSets vs LinkedHashSets, Deques, Maps (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap), hashCode and equals, Comparable vs Comparator interfaces, lambda expressions, functional interfaces, method references. |
| [Java Exceptions](./week1/d5-exceptions-java8/) | Practice handling exceptions, using Java8 features, and I/O: optional class, functional interfaces, lambda expressions, stream API, errors vs checked exception vs unchecked exception, throw/throws, try-catch-finally, custom exception, exception ordering, java I/O streams, bytes and character streams, buffer and file class, serialization vs deserialization. |
